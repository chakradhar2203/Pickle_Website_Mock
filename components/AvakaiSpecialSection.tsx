These green gems are sun-dried to concentrate their natural acids, creating an intense sour foundation that balances perfectly with fiery spices.

The result is a complex, layered heat that builds gradually—warming rather than overwhelming your palate, with a subtle smoky undertone.",

This golden oil doesn't just preserve—it actively enhances the pickle, carrying spice flavors deep into each mango piece. Rich in natural antioxidants, it protects the pickle while adding a distinctive nutty aroma that's quintessentially South Indian.",

        longDesc: "Great Avakai cannot be rushed. After mixing, the pickle rests for 3-4 weeks in ceramic or glass containers, allowing the ingredients to marry and mature. During this time, the spices bloom, the mangoes soften slightly while retaining their bite, and the oil penetrates every fiber. This patience creates the depth of flavor that industrial pickles can never achieve.",
